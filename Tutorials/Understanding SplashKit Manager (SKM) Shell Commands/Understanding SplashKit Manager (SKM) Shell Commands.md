## Introduction to SplashKit Manager (SKM)
### What is SplashKit Manager (SKM)?
SplashKit Manager, also known as SKM, is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool designed for installing and managing SplashKit. SplashKit is described as a beginner-friendly, all-purpose software toolkit. SKM facilitates the installation and management of SplashKit, along with the creation, building, and running of SplashKit projects.

### Installation and setup
To get started with SKM, follow the installation guide linked in the:
[SKM Installation Documentation](https://splashkit.io/installation/)Ensure you have tools like **curl** and **git** installed on your system for a smooth setup process.

## Working with SKM Commands
### Overview of the SKM Command Structure
SKM commands follow a simple structure: `skm [command] [arguments]`. This structure is designed to provide intuitive access to a wide range of functionalities, from project creation to compiler management.

### Basic Usage
The fundamental usage pattern of SKM is straightforward: initiate the command with `skm`, followed by the specific action you want to perform, and any necessary arguments.

### Understanding SKM Commands
Let's delve into the newly introduced commands, providing a detailed explanation, usage examples, and common use cases for each.

#### The `new` Command
- **Function**: Creates a new SplashKit project.
- **Usage**: `skm new [language]`
- **Example**: `skm new cpp`
- **Use Cases**: Starting a new game or software project.

#### The `fix` Command
- **Function**: Fixes common path-related issues within SplashKit projects.
- **Usage**: `skm fix`
- **Example**: Suppose you're experiencing issues where the compiler cannot find SplashKit resources. The `fix` command can rectify these path discrepancies.
- **Use Cases**: Resolving path errors after moving project files or updating SplashKit.

#### The `resources` Command
- **Function**: Creates or manages the resources folder for a project.
- **Usage**: `skm resources`
- **Example**: Before adding images or sound files to your project, use this command to ensure the resources folder is properly set up.
- **Use Cases**: Organizing and accessing project assets like images, sounds, and other media.

#### Version Management Commands (`update`, `revert`)
- **Function**: Manages SplashKit library versions.
- **Usage**:
    `skm update` for updating to the latest version.
    `skm revert` for rolling back to a previous version.
- **Examples**:
    `skm update` to access new features or bug fixes.
    `skm revert` if the latest version causes issues with your project.
- **Use Cases**: Keeping your development environment up-to-date or ensuring compatibility with project dependencies.

#### The `clean` Command
- **Function**: Cleans up build files and temporary files generated during the compilation process.
- **Usage**: `skm clean`
- **Example**: Running `skm clean` in your project directory will remove all the temporary files that are no longer needed, freeing up disk space and ensuring a clean working environment.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for maintaining a clean project directory, especially before pushing changes to a repository or archiving projects.

#### The `config` Command
- **Function**: Views or sets global SKM configuration options.
- **Usage**: `skm config [option] [value]`
- **Example**: `skm config editor vscode` could set Visual Studio Code as the default editor for SKM projects.
- **Use Cases**: Customizing SKM behavior to suit your development preferences, such as specifying a default IDE, configuring default project paths, or setting up proxy settings for internet access.

#### The `clone` Command
- **Function**: Clones an existing SplashKit project from a remote repository.
- **Usage**: `skm clone [repository-url]`
- **Example**: `skm clone https://github.com/user/project.git` would clone the project from the specified URL into the current directory, setting up any necessary SplashKit dependencies.
- **Use Cases**: Quickly starting work on an existing SplashKit project by setting up all its dependencies with a single command.

#### The `deploy` Command
- **Function**: Prepares and deploys your SplashKit project to various platforms, such as WebAssembly, mobile, or desktop.
- **Usage**: `skm deploy [platform]`
- **Example**: `skm deploy web` could compile the project for WebAssembly and provide instructions or perform actions to deploy it to a web server.
- **Use Cases**: Simplifying the deployment process for developers looking to share or test their projects on different platforms.

#### The `test` Command
- **Function**: Runs unit tests or integration tests for your SplashKit project.
- **Usage**: `skm test [options]`
- **Example**: `skm test --all` would run all tests within the project, reporting any failures and summarizing test coverage.
- **Use Cases**: Essential for maintaining code quality and reliability, especially in larger projects or teams.

#### The `uninstall` Command
- **Function**: Removes SKM and SplashKit from your system.
- **Usage**: `skm uninstall`
- **Example**: `skm uninstall` when you no longer need SplashKit installed on your machine.
- **Use Cases**: Cleaning up your development environment or preparing to reinstall SplashKit.
