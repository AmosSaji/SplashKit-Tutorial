# Tutorial Proposal

## Title: Drawing Options Functions with DrawBitmap

## Introduction

This tutorial aims to demonstrate the usage of three essential drawing options functions in Splashkit: Option Part Bmp, Option Rotate Bmp, and Option Scale Bmp. By the end of this tutorial, readers will understand how to combine different drawing options functions and manipulate bitmap drawings in their projects, allowing for dynamic and visually appealing graphics.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, readers should have:

- Basic knowledge of programming concepts.
- Familiarity with the Splashkit library.
- Installed Splashkit (<<https://splashkit.io/installation/>) and set up their development   environment.

## Tutorial Details

### Tutorial Structure

This tutorial will provide step-by-step instructions on how to use each drawing options function individually and then combine them for more complex effects.

### Level of Difficulty

This tutorial is aimed at intermediate programmers with some familiarity with graphics programming and the Splashkit library.

## Examples

- **Example 1: Applying Option Part Bmp**
  This example demonstrates how to use 'Option Part Bmp' to draw only a section of a bitmap, essentially cropping the image. Imagine you have a large bitmap containing multiple images, and you want to display only one specific image from it. You can specify the coordinates and dimensions of the region you want to display using Option Part Bmp. This is useful for situations where you need to focus on a particular part of a larger image.

- **Example 2: Applying Option Rotate Bmp**
  In this example, we showcase how to use Option Rotate Bmp to rotate a bitmap at different angles. This function allows you to dynamically rotate a bitmap to achieve various visual effects. For instance, you can rotate an object in a game to make it appear as if it's moving or spinning. By specifying the angle of rotation, you can control the orientation of the bitmap on the screen.

- **Example 3: Applying Option Scale Bmp**
  Here, we illustrate how to use Option Scale Bmp to scale a bitmap to a desired size while maintaining its aspect ratio. Scaling a bitmap allows you to resize it according to your requirements without distorting its proportions. This is useful for scenarios where you need to adjust the size of an image to fit different screen resolutions or to create zoom effects.

- **Example 4: Combining Options**
  In this example, we explore the combination of drawing options functions to enhance visual effects. By simultaneously applying rotation, such as a 45-degree clockwise rotation, and scaling, such as increasing the size to 150% of the original, to a bitmap, dynamic animations with depth are created. This illustrates the creative potential of combining such functions to elevate the visual appeal of graphics and add complexity to projects, whether in gaming, animation, or graphical applications.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, readers will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and usage of Option Part Bmp, Option Rotate Bmp, and Option Scale Bmp.
- Apply these drawing options functions to manipulate bitmap drawings in Splashkit projects.
- Create dynamic and visually appealing graphics by combining different drawing options.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has introduced essential drawing options functions in Splashkit, providing readers with the knowledge and skills to enhance their graphics programming projects. Experimentation with these functions will enable readers to create engaging visual experiences in their applications.
