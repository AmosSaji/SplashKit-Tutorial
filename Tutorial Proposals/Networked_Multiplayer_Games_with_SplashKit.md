# Networked Multiplayer Games with SplashKit

## Introduction

**Purpose of the Guide**: This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of creating networked multiplayer games using SplashKit. Understanding networking is crucial for developers who want to create interactive and connected gaming experiences.

**Overview of SplashKit's Networking Functions**: SplashKit offers a range of functions to manage network connections, handle data transfer, and synchronize game states between multiple players.

## Setting Up Networked Multiplayer

### Setting Up a Server

**What is a Server?**

A server is a computer or system that provides data, resources, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In a multiplayer game, the server is responsible for managing the game state and ensuring all clients are synchronized.

**Syntax in C++:**

```cpp

void create_server(const string& name, int port);

```

**Example: Creating a Server**

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void start_server()

{

    create_server("GameServer", 12345);

    write_line("Server started on port 12345");

}

```

### Setting Up a Client

**What is a Client?**

A client is a computer or system that accesses services or resources provided by a server. In a multiplayer game, clients connect to the server to receive updates about the game state and send their inputs.

**Syntax in C++:**

```cpp

void create_client(const string& name, const string& server_address, int port);

```

**Example: Creating a Client**

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void start_client()

{

    create_client("GameClient", "127.0.0.1", 12345);

    write_line("Client connected to server at 127.0.0.1:12345");

}

```

## Handling Connections

### Accepting Client Connections

**What is Accepting Client Connections?**

Accepting client connections involves allowing clients to connect to the server and establishing communication channels for data exchange.

**Syntax in C++:**

```cpp

void accept_client();

```

**Example: Accepting Connections**

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void handle_server_connections()

{

    while (true)

    {

        accept_client();

        write_line("Client connected");

    }

}

```

### Connecting to a Server

**What is Connecting to a Server?**

Connecting to a server involves a client establishing a connection with a server to participate in the game.

**Syntax in C++:**

```cpp

void connect_to_server(const string& server_address, int port);

```

**Example: Connecting to a Server**

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void connect_client()

{

    connect_to_server("127.0.0.1", 12345);

    write_line("Connected to server at 127.0.0.1:12345");

}

```

## Synchronizing Game States

### Sending Data

**What is Sending Data?**

Sending data involves transmitting information from one system to another. In multiplayer games, this often means sending player inputs or game state updates from clients to the server.

**Syntax in C++:**

```cpp

void send_data(const string& data);

```

**Example: Sending Player Input**

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void send_player_position()

{

    string data = "PlayerPosition:" + to_string(mouse_x()) + "," + to_string(mouse_y());

    send_data(data);

}

```

### Receiving Data

**What is Receiving Data?**

Receiving data involves capturing information sent from another system. In multiplayer games, this often means receiving game state updates from the server or other clients.

**Syntax in C++:**

```cpp

string receive_data();

```

**Example: Receiving Game State**

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void receive_game_state()

{

    string data = receive_data();

    write_line("Received data: " + data);

}

```

## Example: Basic Multiplayer Game

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic multiplayer game where players can move their characters and see each other's movements.

```cpp

#include "splashkit.h"

void handle_server()

{

    create_server("GameServer", 12345);

    write_line("Server started on port 12345");

    while (true)

    {

        accept_client();

        string data = receive_data();

        send_data(data); // Echo received data back to clients

    }

}

void handle_client()

{

    create_client("GameClient", "127.0.0.1", 12345);

    write_line("Client connected to server at 127.0.0.1:12345");

    while (true)

    {

        process_events();

        string data = "PlayerMove:" + to_string(mouse_x()) + "," + to_string(mouse_y());

        send_data(data);

        string received_data = receive_data();

        write_line("Received data: " + received_data);

    }

}

int main()

{

    open_window("Networked Game", 800, 600);

    if (is_server())

    {

        handle_server();

    }

    else

    {

        handle_client();

    }

    return 0;

}

```

## Conclusion

This guide has covered the basics of setting up a networked multiplayer game in SplashKit, from creating servers and clients to handling data synchronization. Understanding these functions will help you create interactive and connected gaming experiences.
